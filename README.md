# D&D5e Spell Points
 FoundryVTT module for Spell Point System in D&D5e
 
 *Not using spellpoints for your games? well, you should, spellpoints are better than slots!!*
 
 This module use the optional rules found on DMG to allow character to cast spells using a resource named "Spell Points"
 
## Installation Instructions
- Copy "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misthero/dnd5e-spellpoints/main/module.json" into the module installer inside foundry when it asks for the manifest.
- Launch your world go to settings -> module settings and enable the module `dnd5e-spellpoints`.
- Choose the name of the resource to use as Spell Points (default "Spell Points") you can change the name in module settings.
- Create a new resource with the name "Spell Points" on every character sheet, if any of your player need more resources you can use the module https://github.com/ardittristan/5eSheet-resourcesPlus/tree/master
- The module doesn't calculate spellpoints per class/character level right now, the players (or GM) will have to enter that number manully.

You are ready to go, now spells cast by player's characters will use spell points instead of slots.


*Notice* that slots won't disappear from character sheets, but they will always stay full as long as this module is enabled.
